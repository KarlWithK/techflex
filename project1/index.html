	<h2 style="text-align:center">Biography</h2>
	<p>Betsch McGrayne’s The Theory That Would Not Die greatly influenced Jonathan’s worldview.
		In the book, Bertsch delves into Bayes’ theorem, a branch of statistics that quantifies present uncertainty through
		past events. As a statistician, Jonathan realized that his role was to communicate uncertainty and to move away from
		an oversimplified reality. For him, scientific education is more important than ever, especially in an age where
		information with questionable credibility is abundant. </p>
	<p>What bothered Jonathan was not only in the legal industry and its methods. It was in the subject of representation
		and, in his words, the unnecessary need to condense everything down into black and white. “Our environment is much
		more uncertain as minorities. You always have to think, ‘I can be the outlier in so many situations,’” Jonathan
		says.<p>
			<p>
				Currently serving as the lead of the Black Employee Resource Group at Flatiron Health, for Jonathan, advocacy
				groups and causes act as important ways to highlight and communicate the harsh and complex realities that
				minorities have to constantly face. On the side of research, Jonathan puts emphasis on rigor and transparency in
				methods and analysis to challenge scientific biases where they exist.
			</p>


			<p>While working at the Brooking Institute – a policy think tank in Washington, D.C. – he took advantage of the
				educational employee benefits program to learn machine learning at General Assembly. This course laid the
				foundation of the skills necessary for his job at Flatiron Health. In his independent project, he analyzed the
				adverse event data that the US Food and Drug Administration has on prescription drugs. This project would later
				get referenced in abstracts at pharmaceutical conferences. </p>
